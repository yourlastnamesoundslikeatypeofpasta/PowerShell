# Codex Configuration

This directory contains settings for automated code analysis. The
`config.json` file defines the entrypoint module, public and private
folders, and the test configuration. Analysis is limited to the `src`,
`scripts`, and `tests` directories while ignoring generated logs and the
`.git` folder. Adjust these paths if the repository layout changes.
