# Documentation Overview

This folder contains usage guides for the PowerShell modules and commands provided in this repository. Each Markdown file describes a single function or provides general guidance. When in doubt, run `Get-Help <Command>` in PowerShell to see the inline help that matches these documents.

The key guides are:

- **Quickstart.md** – short steps to install the modules and run common commands.
- **UserGuide.md** – detailed deployment information and security notes.
- **SupportTools.md**, **SharePointTools.md**, **ServiceDeskTools.md** – high level summaries of each module and the commands they expose.

- **ModuleStyleGuide.md** – how scripts display progress messages and log output.

Command specific help topics live in the `SupportTools`, `SharePointTools` and `ServiceDeskTools` subfolders.
